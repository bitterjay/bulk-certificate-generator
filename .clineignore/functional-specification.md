# Certificate Generator Web App ‚Äì Functional Specification

## Overview

A web application that enables users to generate printable certificates by pasting data from Excel and uploading a PNG or JPG image (certificate background), configuring layout and content, previewing the results, and exporting the certificates as a PDF. The app is built using only HTML, JavaScript, and CSS (with all CSS in a separate file, not inline).

## Functional Flow

### 1. Data Input ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

- __Paste Data from Excel__

  - **Primary Method (Clipboard API):** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
    - User copies data from Excel to their clipboard
    - User clicks the "Paste from Clipboard" button for one-click data import
    - The app uses the modern Clipboard API to automatically read clipboard contents
    - Browser may prompt for clipboard permission on first use
    - Real-time status feedback shows success, errors, or warnings

  - **Fallback Method (Manual Paste):** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
    - "Manual Paste" toggle button reveals a textarea for users who prefer manual paste
    - Available for users with unsupported browsers or those who prefer manual control
    - Maintains backward compatibility with all browser versions

  - **Sample Data Method (Use Sample Data Button):** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
    - "Use Sample Data" button provides instant loading of realistic test data
    - Loads authentic archery tournament data from test-file.xlsx
    - Contains 8 columns: First Name, Last Name, Club, Age Class, Division, Gender, Discipline, Placement
    - Includes 5 rows of real tournament results with authentic archery club names and divisions
    - One-click operation with immediate data processing and success feedback
    - Perfect for testing, demos, and understanding the expected data format
    - Seamlessly integrates with existing data processing workflow

  - **Browser Compatibility:** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
    - Automatic detection of Clipboard API support
    - Modern browsers (with HTTPS/localhost) get enhanced one-click experience
    - Older browsers automatically fall back to manual paste mode
    - Clear messaging for unsupported browsers or permission denial

  - **Data Processing:** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
    - The app parses the pasted data (tab-separated or CSV format) and converts it to JSON
    - The app extracts the header row(s) and displays all header columns for user selection
    - The app provides an option (e.g., a "Show Table" button) to reveal the full table of pasted data, allowing the user to verify the data visually. When clicked, the button changes to "Hide Table". Clicking again hides the table. The table is displayed using CSS Grid, with headers and cells dynamically generated to show all imported data

  - **Error Handling:** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
    - Clear error messages for empty clipboard, permission denial, or parsing errors
    - Automatic fallback to manual paste when clipboard access fails
    - Status indicators guide users through the process

- __Multi-Format Image Upload__ ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

  - **Extended File Format Support:** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
    - User uploads PNG, JPEG, or JPG images
    - File validation accepts multiple image formats: `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/jpg`

    - Preview image is automatically resized to fit within responsive constraints (400px max height, 300px on mobile)
    - Clean styling with borders, shadows, and proper spacing
    - Preview is hidden by default and only appears after successful upload
    - Provides visual confirmation that upload was successful
    - Shows users exactly what background will be used in certificates
    - Works consistently across all supported image formats (PNG, JPEG, JPG)

### 2. Data Mapping & Configuration ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

    - Selected columns are joined with " - " separator for the concatenated element
    - Order matters: columns are concatenated left-to-right based on drop zone order
    - Empty concatenation creates no additional element (only Name and individual columns shown)

  - **Certificate Output Structure:** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
    - The "Name" element (from "First Name" + "Last Name") - always present
    - The concatenated element (from user-selected columns) - only if columns are selected
    - Each unselected column as its own independent element

- __Date Input__ ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

  - An input field allows the user to select or enter a date
  - A "Today" button next to the date field fills in the current date with one click
  - The selected date will be displayed on the certificate preview and included in the final export
  - Visual feedback confirms when today's date has been set (button briefly shows "Set!")
